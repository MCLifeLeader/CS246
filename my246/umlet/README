Fix UMLet Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to learn more about code maintenance
(fixing problems), code organization and java build issues.  Also, to
receive a brief exposure to the concept of design patterns.

Here are the specific requirements:

 1. Change '.mlt' to '.uxf' in Umlet.java (all occurrences).

 2. Commit this change.

 3. Build the code in your own workspace and run it.  Use the command
    javac -extdirs /home/cs246/umlet -d . source/*.java
    to build the code.

 4. Change all singletons to use a thread-safe approach
    (static initialization).

 5. Rename all prototype's CloneFromMe methods to cloneFromMe.

 6. Use jalopy to "beautify" the files with singletons in them to
    conform to the CS246 Java Coding Standards (no renaming of variables
    or methods, just formatting).

    Enter the following command (after connecting to the source directory):

	/home/cs246/jalopy Umlet.java

    successively replacing Umlet.java with each of the other java files
    to be reformatted. Alternatively, you can supply all at once
    the list of files on the command line, e.g.:

	/home/cs246/jalopy Clip.java Umlet.java UniversalListener.java

 7. Commit these changes.

 8. Build this new code and run it using either the 'umlet.bat' script
    (on Windows) or the 'umlet.sh' script (on Linux).  (This only works
    on Windows if you copy .jar files in /home/cs246/umlet over
    to your H drive, and put it in a H:\cs246\umlet folder.)

 9. Figure out how to provide one script named 'umlet.cmd' that works
    to run the progam under both Linux and Windows.  This script should
    have exactly one line in it -- less than 80 characters in length --
    less than 20 if you're good!

10. Add and commit this script.
