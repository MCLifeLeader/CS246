Particle Class Diagram Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience designing
classes and drawing your design using UML class diagrams.

The classification of elementary particles is complicated because
there are two essential but distinct divisions among them. Do they, or
do they not, satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle (fermions versus
bosons)? Are they, or are they not, subject to the strong nuclear
force (hadrons versus others)?

The following table shows these divisions:

Your task is to use the UMLet tool to create class diagrams for the
"things" mentioned in the above table. This is a simple* tool to use.
The hard part is thinking up a reasonable set of classes/interfaces,
their inter-relationships, and how best to draw them. Neatness and
clarity count. A class diagram should also include a short list (3 or
fewer) of the basic properties and responsibilities of that class (as
much as can be inferred from the table above).

Name your file: particles.uxf

* The instructions for using UMLet are simple. First, you must compile
the source code.  How to do that is in Step 3 in the umlet
assignment's README.  Then start the program using the umlet.sh script
(in the same directory as the README you just read), which invokes the
java command to load the com.umlet.control.Umlet main application
class.  (Yes, UMLet is a java application!)  Read the instructions in
the lower-right corner of the application window when it appears.
Experiment with the various elements in the "palette" just above those
instructions.  Practice saving your file (as particles.uxf) in this
(partcd) directory, NOT the umlet directory!  The .uxf file type is
the default, but you can also save it as a JPG, SVG or PDF file, if
you wish.  Just make sure the .uxf file is the one you submit.

Hints: While the things in this table are named in the plural, Pions,
Kaons, Mesons, etc., are NOT good class names.  Use the singular form
of Pion, Kaon, Meson, etc., instead.  Also, whereas Hadron is a good name
for a class (or interface), NonHadron is most definitely NOT!
