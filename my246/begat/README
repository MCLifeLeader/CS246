Begat-O-Matic Assignment

Write a java program to automatically print nine verses from Genesis
chapter 5. Verses 9-17 have a very regular structure, which can be
printed as follows:

Print three times, filling in new data between the '<>' angle brackets
each time:

<verse number>. And <father> lived <number of years father lived
before he begat son> years, and begat <son>:
<verse number + 1>. And <father> lived after he begat <son> <number of
years father lived after he begat son>, and begat sons and daughters:
<verse number + 2>. And all the days of <father> were <total years
father lived> years: and he died.

Replace <verse number> with <verse number + 3>, replace <father> with
<son> and repeat with new data.

Create any classes of your own you think necessary, but you must use
java.util.StringTokenizer and
java.text.MessageFormat in your solution.

Furthermore, you MAY NOT use classes from any other package (other
than java.lang), or written by anyone else.  In other words, the
following two are the only acceptable import statements you are
allowed:

import java.text.MessageFormat;

import java.util.StringTokenizer;

This means, of course, that any file I/O is verboten. Hardwired data
is likewise forbidden (lookup keys excepted).

This is intended as a test of your ingenuity, to see what you can come
up with given these constraints.  Do your best!

Because one of you asked, I provided hints in class for using "System
properties" to get the data you need. Reading "man java" is the
starting point. To make it unnecessary to type a lot (or use shell
command history) you are allowed to use the supplied begat.sh file to
compile, run and test your program -- it does everything except write
the code!  How do you use begat.sh?  Just enter "begat.sh" (without
the quotes) at your shell prompt, just as you would any other shell
command, like "ls".

The output of your program should look EXACTLY like Genesis 5:9-17, i.e.:

9. And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:
10. And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:
11. And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.
12. And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel:
13. And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:
14. And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.
15. And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:
16. And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:
17. And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred and ninety and five years: and he died.
