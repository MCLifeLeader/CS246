o  Files and Applets

o  An Applet by another name...

   a "Mini" application

o  An Applet is a support class to the browser

   An applet is just a class that is being made available to the
   browser for execution.  It's largely up to the whims and
   desires of the browser to decide on when/where your applet will
   execute.

o  An applet is a subclass of java.applet.Applet

   The functionality needed to create an applet is encapsulated within
   the java.applet.Applet class which is provided by the JDK.  Your
   applet will inherit this functionality and add on to it as needed.

o  Not far from standalone

   As is illustrated by the appletviewer program, applets aren't that
   far from standalone programs.  A frame and a main form a good
   start.

o  Tighter security rules

   Applets run under a different (tighter) set of rules than
   standalone applications.  This is to prevent malicious applets from
   damaging client machines/data.

o  Creating interesting applets

   Interesting applets typically have several features, two of which
   are supported init() and paint() methods.

o  init()

   The init method provide a place for initializing the applet.  It is
   called when the applet is first brought up.

o  paint()

   The paint method is *automatically* called every time the browser
   thinks your window needs repainting.

o  start()

   The applet's start method is called when an applet is on the
   visible page.

o  stop()

   The applet's stop method is called when an applet is removed from
   the visible screen.

o  update()

   The update method's default behavior is to clear the screen, then
   call paint.  This usually causes flicker.

o  What does all this have to do with Files?

   How do you make the FileToucherApplet find its "args".
