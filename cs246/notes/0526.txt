o  Mike Carey, Prayer and Thought

o  Answer Questions

o  Object Class Categories

   -- aka

o  Categories of Object Classes (Types)

   -  Application - useful within one application

   -  Business - useful for one industry or company

   -  Foundation - useful across all industries.

   >APPLICATION<  (minimum reusability)

   - Event administrator

     (for sequence, timing, etc.)

   - Event-activity manager

     (e.g., LoanManager)

   - Event recognizer

     (e.g., detects "loan applied for")

   >BUSINESS< (medium reusability)

   - Relationship

     (ResponsibleFor -- Ownership)

   - Role (entity)

     (Customer, LoanOfficer)

   - Attribute

     (AcctBal, PhoneNum)

     Why AcctBal?

     Because business rules preclude just using "Money"

   >FOUNDATION<  (maximum reusability)

   - Utility / driver

     (Window, Button, Mouse Driver, etc.)

   - Semantic

     (Time, Money, Date, Temperature)

   - Structural

     (Container, Collection)

   Once more, here are the characteristics of the class categories:

      Application

      o  low reusability
      o  shallow inheritance

      Business (Application Infrastructure)

      o  medium reusability
      o  medium inheritance

      Foundation (System Infrastructure)

      o  high reusability
      o  deeper inheritance

o  Quick check

   Where does the functionality belong of taking an integer and
   returning a string of length n with that integer padded with
   up to n - 1 zeros in it?

   (E.g., with n = 5, 1 -> "00001" or 398 -> "00398")

o  Review for Midterm Exam

   30 questions, worth 100 points total.

   True/false, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, plus several short
   answer essay-type (or file-response) questions.

   Covers topics from Head First Java, chapters 1-12, as well as the
   class notes (BOOPOPs, BOODPAPs, etc.), the sample code and the
   programming assignments.

   E.g., know

   What type of class SplitDBF is. (It's a static, "utility" class.)

   How BegatOMatic can be or not be Object-Oriented.

   What issues FileToucher, et al., deal with.

   What the Particles sample code shows.

   At what level of code organization a specified
   piece of functionality belongs.

   True cognition is demonstrated by solving problems under novel
   conditions. Describe how you have demonstrated true cognition in
   the first half of this term, as you have undertaken many new and
   unfamiliar tasks. As you organize your thoughts to divulge them,
   keep in mind the following pentad of imperatives:

		    Read. Know. Think. Choose. Do.
