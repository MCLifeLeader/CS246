   "There is so much of wonderful reading available. We are not likely

   -- President Gordon B. Hinckley

o  Four Principles of Psycholinguistics and Reading

   1.  Reading is a process.

   2.  In order to learn something new, you
       have to be able to "hook" it onto
       something you already know.

   3.  In order to read we must make predictions.

   4.  Predictions are not precise.

   Writing is meant to be read, to give readers something to process.

   Read == riddle

o  More Context for President Hinckley (from his talk on gambling
   at the Priesthood Session of April 2005 General Conference):

   The pursuit of a game of chance may seem like harmless fun. But
   there attaches to it an intensity that actually shows on the faces
   of those who are playing. And in all too many cases this practice,
   which appears innocent, can lead to an actual addiction. The Church
   has been and is now opposed to this practice. If you have never
   been involved in poker games or other forms of gambling, don't
   start. If you are involved, then quit now while you can do so.

   There are better ways to spend one's time. There are better
   pursuits to occupy one's interest and energy. There is so much of
   wonderful reading available. We are not likely to ever get too much
   of it. There is music to be learned and enjoyed. There is just
   having a good time together -- in dancing, in hiking, in cycling,
   or in other ways -- boys and girls together enjoying one another's
   company in a wholesome way.

   [...] Please, please do not fritter away your time or your talents
   in an aimless pursuit. If you do so, it will lessen your capacity
   to do worthwhile things. I believe it will dull your sensitivity to
   your studies in school. It will disappoint your parents, and as the
   years pass and you look back, you will be disappointed with
   yourselves.

   -- President Gordon B. Hinckley
