o  James Comish, Prayer and Thought

o  Answer Questions

   Q. What IS an object-oriented program?

   A. It's a bunch of objects talking (sending messages) to each other.

      The shortest (useful) OOP main method is a one-liner:

         // just construct some class object,
         // presumably its constructor
         // is what does the something "useful"
         new SomeClass();

      Better to construct and then call a method, which
      still can be done as a one-liner, e.g.:

         new SomeClass().doSomethingUseful();

      or as a two-liner, e.g.:

         SomeClass sc = new SomeClass();
         sc.doSomethingUseful();

o  Threads and Runnables

   What is the relationship between a Thread and a Runnable?
