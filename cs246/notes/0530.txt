o  Alan, Prayer and Thought

o  Answer Questions

   Q1. What (in the world) is the "grrZ" principle?!

   A1. It's my observation that these two sentences are very similar:

          John is eager to please.

          John is easy to please.

       They're similar on the surface, but not below.
       Their meanings are very different.

       Applying the "gersy" (the original name) principle means
       looking below the surface, never settling for the superficial!

   Q2. What does "maximize reuse" mean in the context of the Quark
       Collection assignment?

   A2. It means don't write code that's already been written and is
       available for reuse (via inheritance, for example).

   Q3. What abstract collection code is available for reuse in the
       java.util package?

   A3. That's a good place to do some digging and applying of a
       certain principle to answer this question!

o  GUI Design

   GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) in 4 easy steps

   C.L.A.W.

   C omponents (things like Buttons, Labels, TextFields, Panels)

   L ayout     (how components use the screen real estate)

   A ctions    (what should happen when the user "touches" the GUI)

   W iring     (how to hook up the Actions to the Components)

   AWT = Abstract Window Toolkit (java.awt, java.awt.event, ...)

   AWT is not the only GUI Toolkit available.

   - JFC/Swing

   - SWT (Standard Window Toolkit)

   Component is the direct or indirect superclass of all GUI Components,
   including Panel, which extends Container, which extends Component.

   BorderLayout is one of the simplest Layouts:

   You can add components to containers (like Panel)
   on the North, South, East, West or Center of the container:

       +--------------------------------------------------+
       |      North (e.g., for Menu Bars, Tool Bars)      |
       +---+------------------------------------------+---+
       |   |                                          |   |
       |   |                                          |   |
       |   |                                          |   |
       | W |                                          | E |
       | e |                                          | a |
       | s |                 Center                   | s |
       | t |                                          | t |
       |   |                                          |   |
       |   |                                          |   |
       |   |                                          |   |
       |   |                                          |   |
       +---+------------------------------------------+---+
       |      South (e.g., for status message Labels)     |
       +--------------------------------------------------+
