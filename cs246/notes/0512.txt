o  Files and File I/O recap

o  Applets and Java Code Conventions

   What were the problems with the FileToucherApplet?

   Security, file write permission denied
   Availability, getting parameters a different way than String[] args
   Usefulness, why touch a file via an applet at all?!

   Look at Stopwatch applet and application.

o  FileToucher revisited with style

o  FileToucher revisited with substance

   What are various ways to "touch" a File?

   ...and figure out how best to add these behaviors to FileToucher.

   - update timestamp (set last modified time)

   - System.out.println it (the "soft" touch)

   - count it (even softer)

   - add it to a list

   - add it to a list only if it matches a certain pattern
