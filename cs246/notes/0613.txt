   In the lab...

      cd ~/our246/project
      cvs up -d
      export PROJPATH=$HOME/our246/project
      . $PROJPATH/sdk/savetyping.sh

   Once you've done that, figure out the correct order to do
   these next five commands (yes, that requires figuring out
   what each one does!):

      pj
      mj
      ba
      bb
      uou

   Now that you have built the project and run the sudoku
   program, let's start exploring!

   The server has a really simple command-line user interface.
   How do you use it?

   How do you generate the (javadoc) documentation?

   How do you look at the generated documentation?
