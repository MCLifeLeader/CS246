A Note on Notes

Should you be continually taking notes?

Generally speaking, no. Try to listen and grasp the gist of what I am
talking about. However, please jot down questions as they occur to
you, or points that you would like more light on. Passive listening
can be rather soporific!

Significantly, there is a study where half of a large group of
students were told to take notes, the other half were told not to.
At the end of class, the notes had to be turned in and immediately
a test was given. The note-takers had a much higher retention rate
than the non-note-takers. The act of writing something down makes
your brain "take note" better. So, take note!

When is the best time to review?

Research also shows that a student who reviews his or her notes
immediately after a class has better retention than those who
postpone reviewing for a long time.

A good strategy would be to write down key words and hooks to come
back to and link up and compare with my in-class notes, which I will
publish in the /home/cs246/notes directory, usually right after class
every day. The following commands will get you started:

cd /home/c246/notes; more *.txt
