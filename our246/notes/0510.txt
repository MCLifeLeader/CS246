   Look for "code patterns" (NOT "design patterns" -- those
   come later) in this class.

   How can we modify this class to make it behave more like
   the Linux "touch" command?

   Try your hand at this problem.  Modify FileToucher.java
   to do the following:

   Usability requirement: if a filename supplied on the command line
   represents a non-existent file, don't report a failure, just
   silently create it. It will automatically be touched (given a
   last-modified timestamp) in the creation process.

   cp /home/cs246/samplecode/FileToucher.java ~/my246
