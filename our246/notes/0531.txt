o  James Comish, Prayer and Thought

o  Answer Questions

   Q. How is it possible to keep track of three Quark objects
      without using an array, or collection, or list, or set, or ...

   A. Use three Quark object references!

   Q. What are good strategies/tactics for taking the midterm?

   A. Take it in the day, in the lab. Open multiple browser windows,
      one for the test in Blackboard, another just for browsing.
      Open three terminal windows (you'll need them). Control-C to
      exit a java program that doesn't look like it's going to exit
      on its own.

o  GUI Design, continued

   BorderLayoutDemo.java revisited

   What if you want more than the default?

   For example, to get confirmation-before-exiting behavior:

      if (JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(this,
          "Are you sure you want to exit?", "Confirm Exit",
          JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION) == 0)
      {
         System.exit(0);
      }

   What if you want the Buttons to *look* nicer?

      Use javax.swing.JButton instead of java.awt.Button for starters.

   What if you want the Buttons to *feel* nicer?

   In other words, what if you want the Buttons to *do* something?!

      Use an ActionListener and "wire" the button to it.

      How best to do that is the interesting exercise...

   See our246/samplecode/gui/BorderLayoutDemo.java, multiple versions.

o  Fun with Container/Containee Relationships Lab Exercise

   Start with BorderLayoutDemo --
      make it so clicking the "Center" button
      replaces that button with a new panel
      containing a new set of five buttons using the same BorderLayout.

      Replace the "Center" button by adding a new panel to the
      button's parent component with the BorderLayout.CENTER constraint.

   HINT:

         void actionPerformed(ActionEvent actionEvent)
         {
            Component component = (Component) actionEvent.getSource();
            Container container = (Container) component.getParent();
            container.remove(component);
            addButtonPanel(container);
         }

   When it's available, compare your solution with
   our246/samplecode/gui/RecursiveBorderLayout.java
