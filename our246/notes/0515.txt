o  Rick Cochran, Prayer and Thought

o  Answer Questions

o  "Know your Variables and How Objects Behave" quiz

o  A Note on Notes (see notes.txt)

o  The Runnable Interface (java.lang.Runnable)

   Having a license to do anything you want is the Runnable "contract".

   void run() says no data passed or returned, just "run"

o  But first!

   Basic Object-Oriented Program Organizing Principles

   BOOPOP #1

   If you have a "large" main method, you probably don't have
   an object-oriented program!

o  What about the SplitDBF.java code?  Is its main "large"?!

o  What about the FunApplet.java code?

o  Implementing Runnable

   How do we make an applet that "animates" a graphical object.

   We need to have the functionality of a Thread.

   There's a problem, however.  We cannot get that functionality
   by *subclassing* java.lang.Thread because we need to *subclass*
   java.applet.Applet.

   But we CAN implement the Runnable interface.  Doing this guarantees
   the rest of the world (including the Thread class) that we will
   include a run() method in our class.

   See FunnerApplet.java
