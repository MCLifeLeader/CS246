   (To keep in mind as you face various Design Decisions!)

   BOODPAP #1

   Deep levels of inheritance are "bad".
   At most three is a good rule of thumb.

   BOODPAP #2

   Without multiple inheritance "of implementation" there must
   be some "duplication of effort" in code.

	   - OR (in other words) -

   With only multiple inheritance "of interface" some redundant
   code will be unavoidable.

   BOODPAP #3

   If you want your class to inherit from a different class than
   what it is already inheriting from, YOU CAN'T (always) do it!

   Suppose it's a 3rd-party (library) class that you're using, and
   you don't have the source code.

   The class is "closed to modification" -- in other words it can't
   be modified to suit your special purposes.

   Trying to "mix in" functionality is tricky, as we'll see.
   Behavior modification can certainly backfire!

   BOODPAP #4

   Prefer composition to inheritance!

   On what basis should you choose or favor one over the other is the
   "pyrophoric" (burning) question!
