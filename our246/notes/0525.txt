   What is dynamic loading and binding?

   What is the Fragile Superclass Syndrome?

   What is a run-time representation?

o  The Fragile Superclass Syndrome

   Does java suffer from this syndrome?

o  Dynamic Loading and Binding

   * running programs can be dynamically modified
   * many payoffs for developers
   * huge flexibility

   Classes are linked in (or loaded) as required.

   The basic job of any linker or loader is simple:

   It binds more abstract names to more concrete names,
   which permits programmers to write code using the more abstract names.

   E.g., "println" gets bound to "the location 612 bytes from the beginning
   of the executable code for this module."

o  Particles and Collections, finis

   cd our246/samplecode/particles; cvs up; cvs log Particles.java

   (also know how to see the actual changes from revision to
    revision, e.g., cvs diff -r1.4 -r1.5 Particles.java)
