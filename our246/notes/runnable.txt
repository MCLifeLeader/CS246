The "Runnable" interface in many ways epitomizes the beauty and power
of Java.

How so?

Well, to see this you must first familiarize yourself with the javadoc
description of this most excellent interface, which the first hit from
googling "java.lang.Runnable" will provide. (The description, that is,
not the familiarity nor the understanding. That comes later!)

The talk about Threads will perhaps look Greek to you, but don't worry
-- we'll talk more about Threads!

Here are a couple of questions the answers to which are easily
obtainable:

1) How "rich" is this interface (how many methods, what are the return
types and parameter lists, are they simple or complex, etc.)?

2) What restrictions are placed on implementations of this interface?
   In other words, what "general contract" must be adhered to?
